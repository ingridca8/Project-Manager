# Who Are Your Customers and What Do They Want?

As a project manager for a business, you always have to keep the customer in mind. Customer experience beats having the top products or pricing every time.

In the project management world, your customer is anyone who the project may be accountable to. Your service is project management.

## Outcome over output!

Providing a customer with a product that does not meet their requirements, shows that you are not actively using the customer expectations as your guiding light. 

If you begin conversations and projects with both customers and stakeholders understanding what the definition of success is, you’ll achieve your business outcomes while offering a positive experience with everyone involved.

Once you’ve connected with the customer you can begin to empathize with their situation and create an experience from each interaction. These interactions aren’t solely focused on getting the project “done”. For 82% of US consumers, each interaction with project leaders matters; making the most out of each interaction should be your priority to ensure you’re achieving successful outcomes.

## Who are your customers?

Your customers should always be your top priority in business and project management. Again, your customer is anyone who could have an input on the project or be impacted by it. When doing customer analysis, you should be thinking about:

   + who this project will serve
   + who might have something to weigh in about the project
   + what the project’s key benefits to customers

In the first step of forming the customer analysis, think about anyone with a stake in the project. Remember to include the people outside the organization who may be impacted by your projects: contractors, suppliers, unions, shareholders, financiers, government, special interest groups, community, the general public, and future generations.

“Customers” comes to mean not just those who buy the results of the project - it’s anyone who is impacted and can affect the outcome of the project from outside of the org. You might list out names of people responsible for approving certain stages of the project that you weren’t aware of before.

There are many ways to map out your customers and stakeholders; you may not get everyone in the first round, but using tools like a RACI could help when you are planning the project.

### The RACI Chart

A RACI is a chart that defines the customers involved in each activity of a project. The involvements are mapped out based on who needs to be Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed for a task, milestone, or decision when completing a project. There are four roles in a RACI that customers can be grouped into:

   + Responsible: Those who do the work, whether individually or with others, complete the task, objective, or make the decision. These could be people internal or external to your organization
   + Accountable: Those who sign off or approve the work when the task, objective, or decision is complete. They own the work and ensure that tasks are assigned in the matrix for all related activities.
   + Consulted: Those who must give input before the work can be signed-off; we typically keep this group “in the loop.”
   + Informed: Those that need to be kept “aware” of what is happening with progress or decisions but don’t contribute or need to be formally consulted.

The RACI is a perfect tool for listing out and keeping track of your customers. Once you have identified them, begin populating your RACI with the people you’ve identified, like the example below:

Once we have determined who our customers are and how each of them plays a role in this project, we can now begin to move forward with defining what success looks like for each group.
