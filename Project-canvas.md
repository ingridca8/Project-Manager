# The Project Canvas

Do you remember the Business Model Canvas from the beginning of this course, mapping out key values and customer expectations for the business? We can do the same for the project.

Inspired by the A3 (another lean six sigma tool) and derived from the business model canvas (from article 2), a project canvas can be a powerfully simple and visual way to get at the heart of, or conversely, illustrate the big picture of a project.

Project Canvas

You‚Äôve considered all the pieces, now it‚Äôs only a matter of putting them together in your own project canvas. How you format your own project canvas is up to you, but:

    Add a value statement: i.e. what value (not outputs) are you creating for your customers? Use the other pieces of the canvas to deduct that value.
    Don‚Äôt forget to add your customers and their desired outcomes to the right side of the canvas.

You can also use the Business Model Canvas and scale it down to just the Project Canvas. Here‚Äôs an example:

The 

project canvas allows 

project managers to think quickly and logically through a step-by-step visual process that dives into a root cause analysis to ensure all pieces of the puzzle or concerns are addressed.

Armed with your project plan, aka project canvas, it is time to manage your project. Here are some tips to help you do so.

    In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable

This famous quote by U.S. President Eisenhower is equally apt for project management. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to lay out a detailed plan up-front that survives first contact, but having thought through all the pieces - not just tasks & timeline - you will be prepared for when things veer off track and help you manage back toward the plan.

Next, yes, mind the details, but, as the idiom goes, keep sight of the forest for the trees (i.e. mind your big picture) to stay ahead of the pack.

Speaking of staying ahead of the pack, your job is to be helpful to the team. Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO once said:

    (I) need people (team) to run fast; I‚Äôm here to organize the world around them.
