## Organizational change management (OCM)

When an organization goes through a transition, such as layoffs, mergers or acquisitions, and the adoption of new technologies, managers and leaders need to come up with strategies to meet those changes. When employees hear about a change coming, feelings of uncertainty, anxiety or fear also come and could impact employee performance, trust and engagement. In 2019, Gartner reported that the average organization underwent five enterprise changes in the past three years, and 73% of organizations expect more change initiatives in the next few years.

Organizational change management (OCM) goes beyond project management by involving stakeholders from the organization to manage the staff interactions within change to achieve the required business outcome.The primary goal of OCM is helping an organization’s workforce implement tough transitions from the current state to the desired future state. There are many frameworks that organizations small to large, can implement for successful change management.

## Change Management Frameworks

There are many frameworks for managing organizational change. Some popular ones are:

### Defining, Planning, Implementing, and Sustaining

In this framework, you are:

 +   Defining the change to align expectations around the scope of the change, timing, and business impact
+    Planning the change effectively to understand how the change will impact stakeholders and, design a strategy to help them navigate it
 +   Implementing the plan by engaging with leaders and associates to execute the change
 +   Sustaining the change by working with leaders and employees to track adoption and drive lasting change.

This simple model can break down the process of change management, helping you achieve desired outcomes sooner. For organizations that may be highly matrixed or complex, additional frameworks for implementing change may be more appropriate for how your organization implements change. Below will be three different frameworks that provide a systematic approach to managing change:

### “Unfreeze - Change – Refreeze”

This is a 3-step process developed by Kurt Lewin to:

   + Unfreeze any existing perceptions about the organization and processes in the organization.
  +  Change processes and perceptions with training and education, and introduce new approaches to transition to a new way of operating
  +  Refreeze the new way of doing things, so the change is sustained over time. This model is a simple yet practical way of creating the perception that change is required to move forward to the new desired state of the organization as the norm.

### 8-Step Process for Leading Change

Dr. Kotter, a is a best-selling author, award winning business and management thought leader, business entrepreneur and Harvard Professor known for the eight-step success factors for change management and combining them into a methodology from observations of organizational leaders dealing with change.

1. Create A Sense of Urgency

Inspire people to act – with passion and purpose – to achieve a bold, aspirational opportunity. Build momentum that excites people to pursue a compelling (and clear) vision of the future… together.

2. Build A Guiding Coalition

A volunteer network needs a coalition of committed people – born of its own ranks – to guide it, coordinate it, and communicate its activities.

“After being a member of our first Guiding Coalition I was selected to co-lead our second Guiding Coalition. Our work with Kotter gave me the opportunity to explore my own passions in the workplace. As a millennial, it is really important because I’m not sure what type of career I’m going to have, and working with Kotter has exposed me to all different parts of the organization that I wouldn’t have worked with otherwise.”

3. Form A Strategic Vision

Clarify how the future will be different from the past and get buy-in for how you can make that future a reality through initiatives linked directly to the vision.

4. Enlist A Volunteer Army

Large-scale change can only occur when massive numbers of people rally around a common opportunity. At an individual level, they must want to actively contribute. Collectively, they must be unified in the pursuit of achieving the goal together.

“It’s not a project. It’s a movement. It’s a journey. Join us and leave your mark.”
Gert Bosscher / Bunge

5. Enable Action By Removing Barriers

Remove the obstacles that slow things down or create roadblocks to progress. Clear the way for people to innovate, work more nimbly across silos, and generate impact quickly.

6. Generate Short-Term Wins

Wins are the molecules of results. They must be recognized, collected, and communicated – early and often – to track progress and energize volunteers to persist.

7. Sustain Acceleration

Press harder after the first successes. Your increasing credibility can improve systems, structures and policies. Be relentless with initiating change after change until the vision is a reality.

“The way that you can guarantee success in a difficult change… is to not skip any of the steps or the learnings.”

John Ham / COTY

8. Institute Change

Articulate the connections between new behaviors and organizational success, making sure they continue until they become strong enough to replace old habits. Evaluate systems and processes to ensure management practices reinforce the new behaviors, mindsets, and ways of working you invested in.

### The Prosci ADKAR Model

This is a research-based, individual change model by Prosci Jeff Hiatt that represents the five milestones an individual employee must achieve to create organizational change successfully. ADKAR takes a bottom-up approach to provide leadership as a framework, focusing on drivers of personal change leading to the achievement of organizational results. This framework is extremely helpful when leadership doesn’t know where to start.

## Best Practices Make Change Easier

Each of these models introduced above supports the organization through change. They are systematic approaches to minimizing the impact of the change and potential problems that may arise while maximizing the benefits of the change, including motivating teams to remain productive and open to the change. While these are frameworks for implementing change, the chance of success is drastically increased when combined with change management best practices, tools, and techniques.

We often don’t realize the value of organization best practices until we attempt to deal with a major change. Here are some tips to make transitioning through changes easier:

### Involve the customer early on!

Customers pick up on changes quickly, and are either quick to embrace or resist change from the project. When customers are involved early and often in this process, ensuring their concerns are met, you can manage expectations and develop deeper relationships. Agile’s incremental and iterative approach works, involving the customers early and often allows for innovation through rigor, flexibility, and continuous communication.

### Retain organizational knowledge through documentation!

Knowledge management tools like Microsoft Github, Atlassian Confluence, Servicenow Knowledge Management are incredibly useful for teams Microsoft paid $7.5 Billion for their own code and knowledge repository because it allowed software development teams to continuously collaborate and deliver products through change. The best practice here is using the knowledge management tool daily so that processes and knowledge don’t get lost through changes.

### Communicate, communicate, communicate!

When there is a lack of communication, speculation arises, and employees create uncertainties. When communication channels are open, every stakeholder’s expectations can be managed. Information about change should be made as transparent as possible, encouraging confidence, trust, and less chaos among employees. A great communication strategy can also make executing new plans much easier.
