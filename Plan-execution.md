# Major frameworks to get a project plan to execution

In project management, there are two main philosophies for how project management: Agile and Waterfall. Under those approaches, different frameworks provide the structure for project managers to support and deliver successful projects.

## Waterfall

Waterfall is an “old school” project management approach: it is a phased approach that requires deliverables from each phase to be completed before progressing to the next phase. This is a linear process of delivering work which requires the requirements and goals to be established and fixed from the start of a project.

A primary complaint of waterfall, though, is that project requirements, and even the work itself, grow obsolete or stale by the time the next phase starts.

## Agile

Agile is a different project management philosophy that exploded in popularity in the last few decades. The Agile approach centers consumer and business needs, creating quality products that iterate quicker. Agile went mainstream with the launch of the Agile manifesto and Agile Alliance. Following the creation of the alliance, the history of Agile took off in a big way, gaining traction with software development teams throughout the early 2000s.

Compared to Waterfall, Agile does not strictly stick to fixed goals, phases, and start and end days. Feedback is incorporated in shorter time frames and the objectives of the project can stay flexible. Let’s think back to the Iron Triangle of project constraints: scope, time, and costs. In Agile, scope is not the most important constraint. That means with Agile, the project goals may increment throughout the execution.

The Agile manifesto is a document outlining the four key values and twelve principles of this philosophy: The Manifesto states:

>   We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to  value:
>
>
>    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>    Working software over comprehensive documentation
>    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>    Responding to change over following a plan
>
>    That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

With visual management, Agile teams can enhance their ability to work effectively by presenting the data in a visual way rather than in list-form on a spreadsheet or in a wiki. This way, it is easier to comprehend project details and to manage change.

Major benefits of visual project management for Agile include:

  +  Visibility of project details
  +  Increased team efficiency
  +  Ability to adapt to changes
  +  Ability to scale

### Agile Characteristics

Agile is a method for getting the work done that really matters. For example, instead of spending hours or days building out a detailed project plan that may or may not match the project’s execution, an Agile team would begin with a small portion of work, assess progress, then continue down the path once enough feedback has been gathered to indicate they are on the right path.

Principles of how to work as an Agile team are laid out in the Agile Manifesto, a set of guidelines that were developed by software developers to establish expectations around how to operate. These principles place:

 +   People before processes and tools
 +   Working software over documentation
 +   Collaboration over negotiation
 +   Change management over project planning

## How does a Project Manager choose an approach?

There is no one-size-fits-all approach for managing projects. Instead, it is best practice to consider the following factors when deciding on an approach and framework:

  +  Organizational structure (the environment in which the project will be executed)
  +  Budget
  +  Resource capacity
  +  Access to other, internal, resources (e.g. other departments)
  +  Team make-up
  +  Agile aptitude
  +  Training needs Here’s a chart to compare Agile and Waterfall. As you read, think through the pros and cons for projects that you have been part of in the past.

| Agile |	Waterfall |
| --- | --- |
| * High flexibility in change of direction due to iterative cycles of delivery  |	* Low flexibility in change of direction due to established, concrete plans at start of project |
| * Flexibility in changing requirements throughout development is welcome and timelines factor in revisiting previous product increments 	Establishing requirements early can save time initially but errors, bugs or defects mean revisiting previous stages
| * Allows for flexibility in experimenting to meet feedback and different directions. |	* A complete deliverable is required in each stage before progressing to the next stage |
| * High productivity and efficiency throughout development |	* Phased approach could lead to duplicative efforts and lower productivity rates in later phases |
| * High level of transparency into project deliverables and feedback is welcome |	* Low levels of transparency during the project development until delivery |
| * More control of project timelines, lower risk due to high customer interaction |	* Project timelines are more susceptible to change due to difficult timelines and changing needs |

## Hybrid PM Frameworks

Hybrid project management frameworks look to use the best of both worlds. The big picture view of the project is planned with Waterfall in mind (in phases) with a final deliverable clearly defined, and the execution of the project is done with Agile.

Again, it’s critical to weigh these two philosophies for your own projects, thinking about the size and capacity of the team, resources, etc.

# Selecting the Right Frameworks

## Flavors of Agile: Kanban and Scrum
Two of the most popular flavors of Agile for product development are Kanban and Scrum. These two frameworks include best practices for projects and involve specific ways of documenting project progress.

Visualizing the work of the project is central to these two frameworks. Project managers employ various techniques to plan and track tasks, whether it’s sticky notes, spreadsheets, or simple lists. This allows all stakeholders and collaborators to see the complexity of the project, know what is currently in progress or completed, and see where tasks have halted or slowed down.

### Kanban

Kanban follows six core practices:

  +  Visualize the flow of work - Kanban represents and manages project work via a “board” so everyone can clearly see the progress of the work.
  +  Limit WIP (Work in Progress) - establishing limits on the amount of work currently in progress streamlines the flow of work, improving quality and increasing delivery timelines
  +  Manage Flow - the flow of work should maximize value and minimize delivery timelines by being predictable. To manage conflicts, consistently inspect and adapt!
  +  Make Process Policies Explicit - setting strict, well-defined yet simple policies to manage the board, setting the definition of when a task is “done”, how to divide tasks among team members, and the availability of the team to do the work
  +  Implement Feedback Loops - to continuously improve, iterative change is essential and feedback throughout delivery is key to progressive change
  +  Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally - continuous and incremental improvement allows the team to evolve the project experimentally versus implementing major changes less collaboratively

### Scrum

Scrum focuses on planning and delivering outcomes, also in a short time frame. The short timeframe is key to Scrum; projects are broken down into “sprints” which are typically 1-2 week long. These sprints are where work is planned, completed, and delivered! Atlassian (which offers many project management tools like Jira) provides [this article for a more in-depth breakdown of Kanban and Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum) and their corresponding tools.

## Matching Project Management Approach to Organizational Approaches

Whether you are following Agile or Waterfall principles, your organization will also want the project management framework to play well with problem solving approaches in general. Two other organization principles to keep in the back of your mind:

  +  Design thinking is a process that seeks to change how you think about solving problems. This approach seeks to uncover a deeper understanding of the user. It is commonly used to break down problems that are uncommon and involves five steps in deeply understanding your customer: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
  +  Lean Startup is a process that creates minimal viable outcomes (products/solutions) by allowing the customer to determine the value and improving overall production and outcomes. It is focused on eliminating waste by quickly validating a business idea but performing iterations of solutions. One can respond to changes in customer needs faster, similar to Agile, by using shorter, rapid release cycles that produce a minimal viable solution.

This may be a lot to process, so one way to think about how these fit with project management philosophies: Design thinking: what could we build

  +  Lean Start-up: what should we build
  +  Agile/Waterfall: how should we build it
