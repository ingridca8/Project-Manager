# Major frameworks to get a project plan to execution

In project management, there are two main philosophies for how project management: Agile and Waterfall. Under those approaches, different frameworks provide the structure for project managers to support and deliver successful projects.

## Waterfall

Waterfall is an “old school” project management approach: it is a phased approach that requires deliverables from each phase to be completed before progressing to the next phase. This is a linear process of delivering work which requires the requirements and goals to be established and fixed from the start of a project.

A primary complaint of waterfall, though, is that project requirements, and even the work itself, grow obsolete or stale by the time the next phase starts.

## Agile

Agile is a different project management philosophy that exploded in popularity in the last few decades. The Agile approach centers consumer and business needs, creating quality products that iterate quicker. Agile went mainstream with the launch of the Agile manifesto and Agile Alliance. Following the creation of the alliance, the history of Agile took off in a big way, gaining traction with software development teams throughout the early 2000s.

Compared to Waterfall, Agile does not strictly stick to fixed goals, phases, and start and end days. Feedback is incorporated in shorter time frames and the objectives of the project can stay flexible. Let’s think back to the Iron Triangle of project constraints: scope, time, and costs. In Agile, scope is not the most important constraint. That means with Agile, the project goals may increment throughout the execution.

The Agile manifesto is a document outlining the four key values and twelve principles of this philosophy: The Manifesto states:

>   We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to  value:
>
>
>    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>    Working software over comprehensive documentation
>    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>    Responding to change over following a plan
>
>    That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

With visual management, Agile teams can enhance their ability to work effectively by presenting the data in a visual way rather than in list-form on a spreadsheet or in a wiki. This way, it is easier to comprehend project details and to manage change.

Major benefits of visual project management for Agile include:

  +  Visibility of project details
  +  Increased team efficiency
  +  Ability to adapt to changes
  +  Ability to scale

### Agile Characteristics

Agile is a method for getting the work done that really matters. For example, instead of spending hours or days building out a detailed project plan that may or may not match the project’s execution, an Agile team would begin with a small portion of work, assess progress, then continue down the path once enough feedback has been gathered to indicate they are on the right path.

Principles of how to work as an Agile team are laid out in the Agile Manifesto, a set of guidelines that were developed by software developers to establish expectations around how to operate. These principles place:

 +   People before processes and tools
 +   Working software over documentation
 +   Collaboration over negotiation
 +   Change management over project planning
