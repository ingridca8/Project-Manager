# Project Management
Project management spans all sectors to organize work quickly, efficiently, and in a budget-conscious way.

Steps of project management
    + Define the Project Objectives – Pack a lunch for the next two days
    + Gather Requirements – Understand our budget for lunch, what type of meal we want, and the critical ingredients required to build the best lunch possible.
    + Execute the Project – Complete grocery shopping and set up the kitchen to prepare and cook all ingredients.
    + Monitor the Project – Check to ensure your lunch deliverables are met, i.e., vegetables and protein are on schedule to finish cooking. There are risks such as missing ingredients or overcooking to keep in mind. Your project scope and timeline might change if you decide to add fruit.
    + Close the Project – Finish up cooking, maybe going above and beyond, and adding that dessert! This phase is where the lunch is prepared and packed up to eat the next workday.

## What is a Project?

A project is a temporary engagement (something with a definite beginning and end date) to produce a viable and unique product or service that drives value. Anything done as part of a regular cadence or routine is not a project. Anything that repeats forever, is not a project. Any work done towards a one-time effort, seeking a specific outcome is a project. Project tasks are typically built to support a product or service. These tasks can be delivered by a single individual or a group of individuals (resources) and impact a single organization or multiple organizations.

An example of a project in the workplace could be:

   + The improvement or enhancement of a current solution, i.e., migration of database
   + Delivery of a software product that allows virtual collaboration and meeting
   + Consulting with an organization to launch a roadmap that improves organizational processes
   + New construction or renovation of a home

## What is Project Management?

Project Management is the framework that guides a project to be successful. It applies essential knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques across teams to achieve a project’s objectives and key results. Project management enables organizations to execute projects effectively and efficiently through appropriate application and integration of project management frameworks and processes.

A project manager next to a timeline where the product continuously moves into new ideas and opportunities, and projects happen in between with start and end dates.

A project manager organizes, plans, and manages projects by applying skills and applied knowledge to resolve conflicts, risks that can prevent success or delivery, budgets, and schedules while satisfying their customers and other stakeholders involved in the project.

## What about Portfolio, Product & Program Management?

In many large and globally distributed organizations, there are multiple levels of strategic planning before a project is defined and as outputs from a project. The levels and structure are visualized below:

A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, or related work effectively grouped to facilitate effective and strategic management to reach business objectives.

A program consists of a group of related projects coordinated and managed to maximize meeting common business objectives and capabilities that may not be available by addressing them in a silo.

A product is a tangible or intangible item created to solve a fundamental market problem or customer needs. It is typically built in collaboration with Design, Marketing, Business and Technology organizations to ensure its success.
