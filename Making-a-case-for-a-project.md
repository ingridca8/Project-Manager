# Business Alignment

In the "Mini-CEO” role, you may work with organizational leaders to align overall business strategy and drive projects to meet their original goals and business intent. As you begin to think through the business justification behind a project, you’ll need to think through the project’s value and benefits, both tangible and intangible. That includes how well aligned this project is to the business’s success. This evaluation of success and alignment is assessed through a business case.

A good project typically leads to a transformation or improvement in profits, performance and creates lasting improvements. Less than 30% of transformation projects are successful. Still, projects highly aligned to the business strategy are 70% more successful.

## Business Case and Business Plans

Peter Drucker, who BusinessWeek magazine termed as “the man who invented management”, had a “theory of the business”, meaning customer “assumptions about what a company gets paid for.”

Essentially, a **business case** is just that: it will describe the reason a company should explore a new business venture and what they would gain from this investment. Maybe less obvious, the business case also creates discussion and excitement about an idea for the business to invest in.

Very similar, a **business plan** can (and does) the same thing as a business case, but then adds context to the business case (who, what), and includes a high level plan of how to get to the goal.

Both the case and the plan need to include profitability, the timeline for the target audience to realize the value or benefits, and the metrics associated with the value or benefits. This encourages the right conversations before an org breaks ground on the project!

### Mapping Out Your Business Plan

There are two common reasons why new businesses fail: either they don’t know what success means to them or they don’t have a clear path from point A, where they are when they start their company, to point B, where they want to be. A business map solves both problems. 

When a house is built, it’s not produced by just bringing tools and equipment together and winging it. A house is built from a blueprint that has been well thought out and documented, including the home’s look and providing precise measurements. The same is needed in any other type of project. The first step? Brainstorming.

A business map looks at your business in terms of roles, responsibilities and standards. It’s not just a way to get from point A to point B or to achieve certain goals – it’s an in-depth look at what’s working or not working in your business and a path to make changes or improvements that will achieve greater success.

A business map allows for a top-down view of how your business works. It does more than just identify where you want company growth to be in two years or how hiring a sales team will lead to greater profits. Instead, it revolves around introspection – regarding everything from processes, inputs and workflow to why you’re in your particular field and the impact you want to have on your community. 

A business map can come in many forms, including flowcharts, diagrams and value stream maps, or it can be created with various types of software. Don’t get caught up in the details and choose a combination of modules that work best for your company. The format is less important than the questions you ask to develop it and the mindset behind it.

### The Business Model Canvas

This Business Model Canvas provides an organized way for a team to pool their ideas and effectively brainstorm. The BMC should be modern, visual, and streamlined to describe, assess, evaluate and visualize the key elements of business plan and business case.

The canvas explains how your organization would generate revenue and manage costs. Here’s an example of one:

### What is a Project Charter and do I Need One?

At the tail end of the business planning, we need something to present to stakeholders!

Think of a project charter, project management lingo, as the formal business plan for a project. The project charter should highlight the project is driving short-term and long-term value creation through quick and efficient adoption of new technologies and faster development of new products. It’s an elevator pitch to get approval for the project!

A charter is typically the elevator pitch you present to executives for approval of your project, speaking to your project objectives, scope, and responsibilities. An effective charter includes:

  + All the business requirements
  + Milestones
  + Risks

A project charter is typically seen as a very formal and lengthy living document built at the start of the project. 

## What to Consider for YOUR Project

While you work on business cases, plans, and project charters, you have to think of the bigger strategic picture. These are the important questions:

   + What is the project for? When someone uses what you are producing, what are they using it for?
   + Who will be using what you produce in the project. If it’s standing up a website, for example, is it for external consumers or is it for an internal group?
   + What will be the difficult parts?
   + What resources (including humans) will you need to make the project happen. Which do you already have that you’ll be able to leverage? Which will you need to acquire?
   + How much will it cost, in time and/or money, to pull this off?
   + What quantifiable things do we present to show progress?
   + What does done look like?
   + How will you know if it’s working?
   + Who will maintain this project after the first milestone is done?
   + Is it worth it (cost v. benefit)?
   + What does it remind you of? Are there parallels, similar projects, things like this that have come before?
