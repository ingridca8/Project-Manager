# Unpacking the Work to Be Done

Planning a project is not easy. The work must be broken down into sizable chunks that can be delivered within a set schedule. Before planning anything, you should schedule the work. The best approach to scheduling is to first lay out all the work that needs to be done. This is like organized brainstorming, putting everything that needs to be completed on sticky notes, and categorizing them in delivery phases. The project manager should not do this alone, stakeholders and customers should be involved to ensure all tasks are considered.

# Detail out the work

Once you have identified what needs to be delivered, the project team should start breaking down the work by adding additional detail to each task to understand what is required to mark this as “done.” The level of detail is needed to know how big that task is, what resources are necessary to get it done, and in what order.

A helpful way of estimating the effort and resources required to deliver is through t-shirt sizing together. When you have similar tasks, it can be hard to estimate how long it can take to complete an activity, the complexity of the activity, the number of resources required, or all the above. When you think about driving across the country, that could be large, whereas camping in the backyard may be extra small.

This method allows you to organize your activities and projects into sizes to understand the big picture of what you’re trying to accomplish and understand everyone’s perspective on what they believe it takes to get it “done.” After understanding the size – it’s time to order and schedule the work.

# Repack the work

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to scheduling tasks, but having a collaborative team to understand what order tasks or activities can be delivered is extremely important in successful project planning. While some require one to be completed before another begins, others can be done in parallel, such as purchasing materials for framing while laying the foundation of a home or installing electrical and plumbing simultaneously.

A critical path is understanding what sequence of activities must occur and how long each activity will take to finish the project. The “Critical Path Method” is a visual approach to scheduling key project activities required to complete a project on time by outlining the path to completion.

# Tools

There are Project Management and organization tools that can help you visually order and schedule the project plan. These can help the team establish and reference a timeline and any critical dependencies between activities. Some common tools used to plan and prioritize tasks are:

 +   Monday.com
 +   Trello
 +   Asana
  +  MS Project
 +   Wrike

While this is not an exhaustive list, these are some tools to consider to help you organize, quantify and visually showcase the plan for your project.

# Conclusion

 >   “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”
 >   ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

When you are gearing up to kickstart your project, start with a concrete plan and bring your stakeholders and customers in to ensure you capture all the project needs and scoop the work based on the customer outcomes. Break down this work from the start of the first task to the conclusion of the last task and ensure you understand the level of effort and logical sequence your team can deliver. Leverage tools as necessary to ensure the plan is transparent to your stakeholder and communicate updates often. This will create an efficient and viable project!
