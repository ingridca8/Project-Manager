# Mind the Gaps: Constraints, Risks & Dependencies
## Constraints

Again, a constraint is anything that will limit your ability to deliver during the project life cycle. Project managers need to be trained to know if a constraint will impact the success or failure and how to plan to see the project through to the end effectively.

The top three constraints of most projects are:

  +  Scope refers to what should be delivered and what should not be delivered in a project. When you meet with your team to understand the business case and business plan for your project, you must understand the expectations for your outcome.
  +  Time constraints generally show up in the business case and business plan as a definitive start and end date, or how long it takes to deliver something. Project managers need to place tasks into a schedule based around time constraints!.
  +  Cost generally means the total amount of funds (project budget) available to achieve the desired project outcome. To fully understand this constraint, a project manager must understand the expected costs, and forecast and adjust costs as the project progresses.

Collectively these are known as the iron triangle. all three affect project quality.

If you were to combine the three, you would have a great, cheap product developed quickly. The infamous unwritten rule is that you can have two of the three, but not all three. For example, you can produce excellent software (scope) in a short time, but it’s going to cost you in resources.

Let’s explore how scope, time, and cost impact projects through the example of building a home.

 +   Scope: You may understand the project’s scope as a 5,000-square-foot home that sits on an acre lot. More specifically, you may hear that it needs to be five bedrooms and four bathrooms, and 4,000 of it is heated with an outdoor pool. If the team were to add a basement or tennis court, they would consider this out of this project’s scope.
 +   Time: Think of a customer requesting their dream home built no later than twelve months from the contract signing date. If the project is delivered past schedule, it impacts several other stakeholders: financing from the bank, the builder’s resource availability on other projects, and most importantly, the family’s livelihood. We’d need a well-defined plan!
  +  Cost: When a customer purchases a home, they have a set budget for that home. The budget is considered when buying all the building supplies for the home, and the project manager here needs to keep track of these funds while allocating resources.

The iron triangle of scope, time, and cost places scope at the top because it is fixed, while the other two are variable. The fixed scope is a crucial component of a project delivered in a Waterfall framework, while Agile “flips the iron triangle,” making scope a variable and fixing cost and time.

## Dependencies

Even with a flipped triangle, we still need to consider dependencies on all three sides of the Iron Triangle. When project planning, you will need to make some assumptions about things needed to execute a project.

For example, in the house example you might assume that you’ll have 50% of a developer’s time to build the home’s frame and that the lumber cost will stay consistent within this year. Each of the input assumptions is a dependency for the project. A dependency is a constrained task, resource, or activity that relies on completing or understanding another task, resource, or activity. In this example, a pivotal dependency to the delivery of the frame is the availability of the concrete contractors to lay the foundation of the home. This is also known as a Finish to Start dependency. This means the first task must be completed to pave the way for all following tasks to begin.

Some other common project dependencies are:

 +   Start to Finish dependencies require the first task to be started or in progress so the second task can finish. A great example of this is upgrading a website; one must exist for the upgrade to begin.
 +   Start to Start dependencies require that the second task only begin when the first task has started; both tasks can also be delivered in parallel. When the concrete foundation is poured, it goes through leveling (and re-pouring if needed).
  +  Finish to Finish dependencies requires the first task to be completed before the second task is also completed, meaning these tasks can run in parallel but cannot finish until the first task is completed.

These dependencies are similar to constraints in that they can also be viewed as project risks that could hinder the project’s success. 

## Risks

In project management, project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project and have a negative or a positive effect on progress towards project objectives. In other words, anything that could go wrong.

Some examples of project-related risks could be having developers who are early in their career versus senior developers, going over your project budget, and additional asks that extend outside the scope (aka scope creep).

Risk management in project management starts with identifying project risks.

There’s no way to account for all possible project risks, so we need to focus on finding the most impactful ones via a few key avenues of research. These include:

   + Interview stakeholders to find out about risks which have affected the organization or team’s previous projects.

   + Identify external risks using a situational analysis framework such as PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal).

   + Analyze your project planning documentation to identify inherent risks of the project.

Create a shortlist of project risks, good and bad, and plan for how the project would navigate the potential effects.

Once a project is underway, a more active phase of project risk management begins.

As long as the risk has not yet occurred, the project manager can simply monitor the risk until the project ends or the risk expires. This should be done within the project management dashboard.

If a known project risk does occur during the project, the project manager should then use measures devised during project planning to mitigate negative effects and maximise positive effects.

Project risks can be good or bad for the project. With proper planning, they can become even better; without it, they can become even worse.

These are some other common risks:

 +   Underestimating the amount of work (or scope) needed for a successful outcome
 +   Lack of clarity around the scope (project goals and delivery objectives)
 +   Having stretched resources or resources with a lack of deep experience
 +   Changes or additions to the scope of the project, aka scope creep
 +   Fixed timelines that frequently cause time crunches based on the scope

While we cannot think of all the risks associated with a project, we should discover which risks are the most impactful and focus on how they will affect the project’s success. Some tips coming up!

## Managing the Gaps

In project management, risk management is the practice of identifying, evaluating, and preventing or mitigating risks to a project that have the potential to impact the desired outcomes. Risk management is vital to the success of every project; when a risk has not happened, the project manager still has an opportunity to manage or eliminate the risk if possible through monitoring.

The process for managing risks starts by listing out all the known risks! A widely used way of keeping track of lists is called a RAID log. This is a living document that lists out and evaluates project constraints, risks, and dependencies. On here, risks can be analyzed using historical knowledge and gathering intel from stakeholders. From here, we should come up with a plan to either eliminate the risk (by adjusting something within the project) or monitor it.

It is good practice to review the RAID log with project sponsors, stakeholders, and team members on a regular basis. So what does a RAID log look like?

A RAID log can be as simple as an Excel sheet.

RAID log as Excel sheet showing risks, assumptions, actions, issues

   + Items are entered in the RAID log up front and as the project progresses, each coded as a risk, assumption, action, issue, dependency or decision
   + For each item entered, there should be a description of the situation and action steps or mitigations
   + Ongoing maintenance can include the following:
       + Assign risk ownership: assign responsibilities to someone with expertise in the risk area
       + Categorize or re-categorize the risks as necessary, such as moving risks to decisions
       + Create discussion and strategy around high priority risks
